# School-Projects

### Assignments completed for classes while completing my bachelors in computer science at UC Davis.

Assignments are sorted first by quarter, then class, then assignment number. Quarter three is not included as I did have any programming classes that quarter. Most files are exclusively programming related, however some of the files in ECS 122A are for math problems. These were originally only stored for personal use and the organization improves as time goes on due to this fact.

Currently the most impressive project from my classes is the 50man project located at School-Projects/Q4/Hw 6. This is a cusp program that encodes a game very similar to pac-man.
